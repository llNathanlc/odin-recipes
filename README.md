# odin-recipes
This is a project made by following The Odin Project course, this project consists on making a basic recipe website using only HTML, the point of this exercise is to put in practice my HTML knowledge up to this point.

After this project is completed i'll have a deeper understanding of the HTML language and of the GIT tool.

Later on this project will be modified using CSS.
